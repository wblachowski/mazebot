# mazebot
Autonomous maze solving robot. Project based on Atmega328 microcontroler.
The machine uses a set of HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors to move around maze.
Project includes motor.c file, which is responsible for motor control with L293D bridge, and sonar.c, which operates sensors using timers and interrupts.
