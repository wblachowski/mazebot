# mazebot
Autonomous maze solving robot. Project based on an Atmega328 microcontroler.
The machine uses a set of HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors to move around a maze.
Project includes the motor.c file, which is responsible for motor control with a L293D bridge, and sonar.c, which operates sensors using timers and interrupts.
